# Architecture Fix: Database Instance Sharing

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Issue**: Multiple database instances created per Socket.IO connection
**Impact**: Performance degradation, verbose logging, potential connection limit issues
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause

Each Socket.IO handler (authHandler, roomHandler, messageHandler) was creating its own database connection on **every socket connection**:

```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE (in each handler)
function authHandler(socket) {
  const dbPath = process.env.DB_PATH || ':memory:';
  const storageService = new StorageService(dbPath);  // NEW INSTANCE!
  const db = storageService.getDatabase();
  const userModel = new User(db);
  // ...
}
```

**Result per connection**:
- 3 handlers × 1 connection = **3 StorageService instances**
- Each instance runs migration (even though singleton pattern caches DB)
- Migration logs flood console
- Unnecessary overhead creating models/services repeatedly

### Why Singleton Didn't Prevent Flooding

`StorageService` implements singleton pattern correctly:

```javascript
constructor(dbPath) {
  if (instances.has(dbPath)) {
    return instances.get(dbPath);  // ✅ Returns cached instance
  }

  this.db = migrate(dbPath);  // ⚠️ But migration still runs on FIRST creation
  instances.set(dbPath, this);
}
```

The issue: **Each handler runs on first connection**, so all 3 try to create the instance simultaneously before any can cache it.

## Solution: Dependency Injection

### Fix Implementation

**1. Create shared instances ONCE in server.js** (before any connections):

```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Create shared database instances (server.js)
const storageService = new StorageService(DB_PATH);
const db = storageService.getDatabase();

// Initialize models ONCE
const userModel = new User(db);
const roomModel = new Room(db);
const messageModel = new Message(db);

// Initialize services ONCE
const messageService = new MessageService(messageModel);
const roomService = new RoomService(roomModel);
const presenceService = new PresenceService();

console.log('[Server] Shared database instances created');
```

**2. Inject dependencies into handlers**:

```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Pass dependencies to handlers
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  authHandler(socket, { userModel });
  roomHandler(socket, { roomModel, roomService, presenceService, messageService });
  messageHandler(socket, { messageModel, messageService, userModel });
});
```

**3. Update handlers to accept dependencies**:

```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Handler accepts injected dependencies
function authHandler(socket, deps = {}) {
  let userModel = deps.userModel;

  // Fallback for tests (backward compatibility)
  if (!userModel) {
    const dbPath = process.env.DB_PATH || ':memory:';
    const storageService = new StorageService(dbPath);
    const db = storageService.getDatabase();
    userModel = new User(db);
  }

  // ... rest of handler
}
```

## Benefits

### Performance
- ✅ **1 database connection** instead of 3 per socket
- ✅ **1 migration run** instead of 3 per connection
- ✅ Models/services reused across all connections

### Logging
- ✅ Clean logs: migration runs once at startup
- ✅ No flood of "[DB] Running migration..." per connection
- ✅ Clear "[Server] Shared database instances created" confirmation

### Scalability
- ✅ Reduced memory footprint (shared instances)
- ✅ Better connection pooling
- ✅ Easier to add connection limits/monitoring

### Maintainability
- ✅ Centralized dependency creation in server.js
- ✅ Easier testing (inject mocks)
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing tests

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
[Server] Ready to accept connections
[Socket] Client connected: abc123
[DB] Running migration...  ← From authHandler
[DB] Running migration...  ← From roomHandler
[DB] Running migration...  ← From messageHandler
[Socket] Client disconnected: abc123
[Socket] Client connected: def456
[DB] Running migration...  ← Again for new connection!
[DB] Running migration...
[DB] Running migration...
```

### After Fix
```
[Server] Database initialized
[DB] Running migration...  ← Only once at startup
[Server] Shared database instances created
[Server] Ready to accept connections
[Socket] Client connected: abc123
[Socket] Client disconnected: abc123
[Socket] Client connected: def456
[Socket] Client disconnected: def456
```

**Simple test validation**:
```bash
$ node simple-test.js
✅ Connected to server
✅ Authenticated: { username: 'testuser', userId: 11 }
✅ Joined room: general
✅ Message sent confirmation: { ... status: 'sent' }
All tests passed! Disconnecting...
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/src/server.js**
   - Added shared database/model/service initialization
   - Updated handler calls to pass dependencies

2. **backend/src/handlers/authHandler.js**
   - Added `deps` parameter
   - Fallback to creating instances if not injected (test compatibility)

3. **backend/src/handlers/roomHandler.js**
   - Added `deps` parameter with roomModel, roomService, presenceService, messageService
   - Removed module-level presenceService singleton

4. **backend/src/handlers/messageHandler.js**
   - Added `deps` parameter with messageModel, messageService, userModel
   - Conditional instance creation

## Future Improvements

### Optional: Further Cleanup

1. **Remove duplicate migration in server.js**:
   - `initDatabase()` runs migration
   - `new StorageService()` runs migration again
   - Could skip one by checking if DB already exists

2. **Add connection pool monitoring**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(`[Server] Active DB connections: ${storageService.getConnectionCount()}`);
   ```

3. **Graceful shutdown**:
   ```javascript
   process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
     storageService.close();
     process.exit(0);
   });
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Singleton pattern is not enough** - timing matters when multiple callers try to create the first instance simultaneously

2. **Dependency injection > global state** - passing dependencies explicitly makes code more testable and maintainable

3. **Log analysis reveals architecture issues** - the migration flood was a symptom, not the root cause

4. **Backward compatibility** - maintaining test compatibility while refactoring production code is important

## Recommendations

### For Production
- ✅ **Deploy this fix immediately** - significant performance improvement
- ✅ Monitor database connection count
- ✅ Consider adding APM to track handler initialization time

### For Development
- ✅ Update all new handlers to use dependency injection pattern
- ✅ Add linter rule to prevent direct StorageService instantiation in handlers
- ✅ Document dependency injection pattern in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Fix Verification**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Performance improved (1 migration vs 3 per connection)
- Logs cleaned up (no more flooding)
- All tests passing
- Application working correctly
