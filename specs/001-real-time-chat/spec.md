## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users access the chat system through a web browser. They join one chat room at a time to communicate in real-time with other participants. They can see who is currently online, send messages that appear instantly to all room members, and review message history from previous conversations. Users know when others are present through visual indicators, ensuring they understand who can see their messages. Users can switch between different rooms, but can only be active in one room at any given moment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in user accessing the system via web browser, **When** I enter a chat room, **Then** I should see all previous messages from that room's history and my presence indicator should appear to other users in the room
2. **Given** I am in a chat room with other users, **When** I send a message, **Then** all other users in the same room should receive and see my message immediately without refreshing the browser page
3. **Given** I am viewing a chat room in my browser, **When** another user joins or leaves the room, **Then** I should see their presence status update in real-time without manual refresh
4. **Given** I have been offline, **When** I rejoin a chat room via my browser, **Then** I should see all messages that were sent while I was away
5. **Given** I am typing a message in the web interface, **When** I submit it, **Then** it should be persisted to the message history and remain visible after I leave and return to the room
6. **Given** the system restarts, **When** I rejoin a chat room via browser, **Then** all previously sent messages should still be available in the message history
7. **Given** I have an active browser connection, **When** another user sends a message, **Then** I should receive it through the persistent bidirectional connection without polling
8. **Given** I am using a web browser, **When** I navigate the chat interface, **Then** all UI elements should be responsive and accessible via mouse and keyboard
9. **Given** I am in chat room A, **When** I join chat room B, **Then** I should be removed from room A and my presence should only appear in room B

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user loses internet connection while in a chat room? After 5 retry attempts at reconnection, display error message that they are offline, then give them the option to re-connect again.
- How does the system handle message ordering when multiple users send messages at nearly the same time? Use the user's machine timestamp to determine ordering of messages.
- What happens when a user tries to view message history for a room with thousands of messages? Use pagination with each page no more than 50 messages and ability to change page size to 100, 200 and 500.
- What happens when a user switches from one room to another? Leave the current room (remove presence), join the new room (add presence), and load the new room's message history.
- What happens if a message fails to send? Retry up to 3 times and display error message to try again later.
- What happens if file storage becomes corrupted or inaccessible? Log error to console and display user-friendly error message indicating data access issue.
- What happens if the persistent connection drops unexpectedly? Attempt automatic reconnection up to 5 times before notifying user.
- What happens if a user accesses the chat from a browser with JavaScript disabled? Display message that JavaScript is required for the chat system to function.
